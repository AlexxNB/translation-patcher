# translation-patcher

This is tool for translating any open source site which has sources in GitHub or Gitlab repository. Just write translated files or strings and `translation-patcher` will do all hard work.

## Getting Started

Run this command where you want to place the directory for new translation project:

```shell
npx trpatcher init
```

This will ask the name for new project directory, add some sample files and install dependencies.

That is it! Read further information about translation process in the [README.md](https://github.com/AlexxNB/translation-patcher/blob/master/template/README.md) in the new project directory.
